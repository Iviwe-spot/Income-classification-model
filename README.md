An interesting school project for creating an income classification modelðŸ’°
Using Decision Tree and Random forest to then decide which model is better.
The dataset had 32000 datapoints with over 8 features.
Had to clean and preprocess the data fron null cells and string values
Used the Spark library to handle the large amount of data.
The model achieved 85% and 86% accuracy rate respectively.
